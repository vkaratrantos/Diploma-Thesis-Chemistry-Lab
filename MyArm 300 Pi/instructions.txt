If you want to use the modified workspace for the MyArm 300 Pi robot with the Thorgripper, you have to follow these instructions :

1. Install and build the official Elephant Robotics workspace (https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros2). Make sure to select the branch correctly, according to your version (for me it's Humble).
2. Replace the URDF folder in 'src/mycobot_ros2/mycobot_description/urdf/myarm_300_pi' with the URDF folder here.
3. Correct the URDF filename and path in the launch files (if you have changed it).
4. Build your workspace again.
5. Launch one of the launch files.
